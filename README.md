# Essential_Design_Patterns_in_C-Sharp_by_Steven_Nikolic

This book/lesson material is free to use and share unmodified.

The aim is to explain, as simply as possible, the most common design patterns I have used.
All examples are represented in the C# language, but the concepts discussed (the crucial parts) extend to any language.

The book is structured as lessons you can take in sequential order: progressing from simpler to more complex/derivative patterns.

Or it can be used as an ad hoc reference, with a handy table of contents and cheatsheet.

Below is a list of the patterns and sections included:

Introduction

Singleton
Prototype, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Structural Wrappers
Adapter
Bridge
Proxy
Facade
Decorator
Composite
Template Method
State
Strategy
Observer
Command
Iterator
